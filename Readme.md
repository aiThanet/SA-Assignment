# Context
Our customers have no concrete AWS knowledge background and are encountering an issue when launching a web application as a proof of concept. Therefore they contact us seeking guidance. First, troubleshooting the current implementation to make the web application operational with minimum effort. Secondly, proposing a short term solution to improve the availability, security, reliability, cost and performance before the project goes live. Lastly, they want to have a long term solution plan to operate their website on a large scale.
